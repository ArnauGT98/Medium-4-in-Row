# Connect Four Documentation
## Introduction
Connect Four, also known as Four in a Row, is a classic two-player connection board game. The objective of the game is to be the first player to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs.

## Rules
Board Setup: The game is played on a vertical grid with six rows and seven columns. Players take turns dropping colored discs from the top into a chosen column.

## Objective: The goal is to connect four of one's own discs of the same color next to each other vertically, horizontally, or diagonally before the opponent.

- Turns: Players alternate turns, with one player using colored discs and the other using a different color.

- Dropping Discs: On a player's turn, they choose a column and drop one of their discs into the lowest available space in that column.

- Winning: The game is won by the first player to form a line of four discs of their color consecutively in any direction: horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

- Draw: If the entire board fills up without either player achieving a line of four, the game is a draw.

## Implementation Details
- Language: The game is implemented in [Python].
- Board Representation: The game board is typically represented as a two-dimensional array or grid.
- User Interface: The game may have a graphical user interface (GUI) for user interaction, displaying the board and allowing players to make moves.
